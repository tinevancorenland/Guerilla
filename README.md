Assignment:

We have a good client that has a very important event tomorrow and they just realized that their digital presence is crap. 
I did what I could to improve this so that by tomorrow they have a one-pager that is better than what they have today."

Material used:

For this assignment I used "Phantom by HTML5 UP"

	Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)


	This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
	image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
	SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
	you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.

	Demo images* courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images
	you can use for pretty much whatever.
