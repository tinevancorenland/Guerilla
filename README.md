Assignment:

We have a good client that has a very important event tomorrow and they just realized that their digital presence is crap.
I did what I could to improve this so that by tomorrow they have a one-pager that is better than what they have today."

Focus of the changes:

I kicked everything that was not essential, and focused on the main stuff: selling their products. By adding simple categories and a nice image, the attention focuses on the products.

Further info taken into the new website is the 'background info' about the owners to make it personal, 'contact info' to find the location and opening hours, and 'news' for adding coming events.

Material used:

For this assignment I used "Phantom by HTML5 UP"

    This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
    image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
    SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
    you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.

    Demo images* courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images
    you can use for pretty much whatever.
